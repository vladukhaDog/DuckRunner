/// Coordinates validation of a user's replayed route against a recorded track.
///
/// `TrackReplayValidator` builds a series of geo-spatial checkpoints along a given
/// recorded ``Track`` and then evaluates incoming location samples to determine
/// whether those checkpoints have been passed. The validator is an `actor`, which
/// means its mutable state (like the `checkpoints` dictionary) is protected by
/// actor isolation and is safe to use from concurrent code.
///
/// Checkpoints are created along the polyline of the original track at a fixed
/// distance interval (by default every 500 meters). As the user moves and the
/// app feeds points to the validator via ``passedPoint(_:)``, the validator will
/// mark checkpoints as passed when the user's position falls within the
/// checkpoint's acceptance radius. Completion can be queried as a fraction in
/// the range 0.0–1.0 using `trackCompletionByCheckpoints()`.
